GtfsProc - How to Install / Run / Operate
-----------------------------------------

This small guide explains how to setup GtfsProc and synchronize it with transit
agency data (which will [probably] change from time to time) so the process 
stays mostly maintenance-free.

GtfsProc relies on periodically-changing transit operator data, so running a
standalone server for a long period of time means data will go out of sync with
any updated schedules.

Several individual moving parts will help in this process:
1) The following are required to build GtfsProc, install from your package manager:
   Note: this is heavily Debian biased ;-)
    - qt5-default
    - qt5-qmake
    - qtdeclarative5-dev
    - libcsv-dev
    - protobuf-compiler
    - libncurses-dev

   The following packages are good to have for retrieving static data
    - unzip and zip
    - wget

2) Optional: Setup a GtfsProc-specific UNIX user on which to run it

3) Under the new user, download, build, and install GtfsProc:
    A) Clone/extract/whatever the gtfsproc sources
    B) qmake
    C) make
    D) sudo mkdir /opt/gtfsproc
    E) sudo cp (GtfsProc's buildDirectory)/gtfsproc/gtfsproc /opt/gtfsproc/gtfsproc
    F) sudo cp (GtfsProc's buildDirectory)/client_cli/client_cli /opt/gtfsproc/gtfsclient
        (This step is optional, not everyone will want/need the test client!)

4) For each agency you wish to support, copy the included gtfsproc_agent.sh file
   into /opt/gtfsproc (for example: /opt/gtfsproc/agent_RIPTA.sh). See the 
   instructions in gtfsproc_agent.sh. This file is responsible for:
    A) Killing GtfsProc each night
    B) Checking for new upstream data each night, if available, download and 
         unzipping the new files in place of the old ones.
    C) Restarting GtfsProc

5) 

The data retrieval from the realtime server is handled within the actual
GtfsProc server, but the static dataset is downloaded separately.
