GtfsProc - How to Install / Run / Operate
-----------------------------------------

This small guide explains how to setup GtfsProc and synchronize it with transit
agency data (which will [probably] change from time to time) so the process 
stays mostly maintenance-free.

GtfsProc relies on periodically-changing transit operator data, so running a
standalone server for a long period of time means data will go out of sync with
any updated schedules.

Several individual moving parts will help in this process:
1) The following are required to build GtfsProc, install from your package manager:
   Note: this is heavily Debian biased ;-)
    - qt5-default
    - qt5-qmake
    - qtdeclarative5-dev
    - libcsv-dev
    - protobuf-compiler
    - libncurses-dev

   The following packages are good to have for retrieving static data:
    - unzip and zip
    - wget

   If you wish to use the gtfsproc_agent.pl script, you will also need:
    - perl
    - curl
    - wget

2) Optional: Setup a GtfsProc-specific UNIX user on which to run it

3) Under the new user, download, build, and install GtfsProc:
    A) Clone/extract/whatever the gtfsproc sources
    B) qmake
    C) make
    D) sudo mkdir /opt/gtfsproc
    E) sudo chown (GtfsProc user's name) /opt/gtfsproc
    E) cp (GtfsProc's buildDirectory)/gtfsproc/gtfsproc /opt/gtfsproc/gtfsproc
    F) cp (GtfsProc's buildDirectory)/client_cli/client_cli /opt/gtfsproc/gtfsclient
        (This step is optional, not everyone will want/need the test client!)

    Note for E/F above: You could also just do a symbolic link to the binary.

5) Start the agent or gtfsproc binary itself in a screen session or however else
   you like to keep stuff running in perpetuity. 

TODO: Include some kind of installer or service that can be run at system startup.
